Trello Feature Board: https://trello.com/b/pO2yKzYp/log 

Log is a lightweight logging system designed around ease of use and functionality. 

This project was built and includes project files for Visual Studio 2015. It was built to run only on Windows, 64 bit platform for now.

To use the system:

1. Include Log.h in your file.
2. Use DA_DECLARE_LOG_CATEGORY() to declare a specific log category that contains unique attributes to it.
3. Use DA_LOG() in code to log whatever information your program requires. 

See ExampleUsage.cpp for a demonstration of using the system.
